    <h2>Classic Crispy Fish and Chips</h2>
    
    <p>This British pub-style fish and chips features ultra-crispy beer-battered cod with golden, fluffy chips. The secret is in the ice-cold batter and double-fried chips for perfect texture.</p>
    <p>Served with tartar sauce and malt vinegar, this is the ultimate crispy yet light fish with chips that stay crunchy outside and fluffy inside.</p>

        <li>In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water, add vinegar and 1 tsp salt. Bring to boil, then simmer for <span class="time">3-4 minutes</span> until slightly softened but not falling apart.</li>
        <li>Drain well and pat completely dry with kitchen towels. Let air-dry for <span class="time">10 minutes</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>First Fry (Chips)</h4>

        <li>Gently fold in whipped egg white just before frying.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Final Frying</h4>
    <ol start="11">

        <li>Fry fish in 375°F oil for <span class="time">4-5 minutes</span> until golden brown and crispy. Drain on wire rack.</li>
        <li>Fry chips again at 375°F for <span class="time">2-3 minutes</span> until golden and crispy. Salt immediately.</li>
